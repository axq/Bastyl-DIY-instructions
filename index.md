- (Optional) Heat gun

## Step 3 - Install screw inserts

- Set your soldering iron temperature to 300 degrees if you can.
- Using the soldering iron, place the heated insert inside the hole
- *Apply little to no pressure, let the gravity do the work*
- Once the insert is 2/3 of the way in, stop 
- Flip over the case and push it against a flat surface, to make the insert flush with the case
