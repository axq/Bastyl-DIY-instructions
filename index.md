## How to use this guide

The DIY kit is currently in beta. This guide is meant to help you go
through a build. You can click on the pictures to look at a full-res
version of them

## Kit contents

Before beginning, please check that your kit has all the elements you will need. Should something be missing, please contact us immediately. 

Use the kit paper you got with your order.

## Required tools and material


You will need to buy yourself :

- 1 Usb-C cable
- 1 Standard audio cable

To build this keyboard, you will need:

- Soldering iron
- M4 torx or flathead screwdriver
- Soldering tin
- (Optional) Wire stripper
- (Optional) Hot glue gun
- (Optional) Heat gun

## Screw inserts

There are 12 screw inserts to install, 6 on each side of the keyboard

- Set your soldering iron temperature to 300 degrees if you can.
- Using the soldering iron, place the heated insert inside the hole
- *Apply little to no pressure, let the gravity do the work*. Otherwise, you might push them too far
- Once the insert is 2/3 of the way in, stop 
- Flip over the case and push it against a flat surface, to make the insert flush with the case

## Diodes and cables

**Pay attention to the orientation of the PCBs: you need two "right", and two "left"**

- Solder all the diodes on the four PCBs (flexyls and thumb clusters)
- Check the orientation of the diodes: use the indications on the PCB

## Ribbon cables

Cut the ribbon cables using scissors or a cutter:

- 4 * ribbons of 6 cables
- 2 * ribbons of 5 cables

- Solder the 6-cable ribbon cables on the thumb cluster PCB
- Solder the other end on the flexyl PCB, at the bottom - **make sure the legends align !**. C5 should be connected to C5, C6 to C6, and so on
- Solder the 6-cable ribbon cable to the bottom part of the top connector of the Flexyl - R4 to R5
- Solder the 5-cable ribbon cable to the top part of the top connector of the Flexyl - C3 to R2

Now, all the cables should be used on the PCBs.
